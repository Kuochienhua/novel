# 第 14 章：未命名章節

The air hung thick and humid, a green blanket woven from ancient jungle leaves and the scent of damp earth. Ahead, a yawning archway, half-swallowed by emerald vines, beckoned us deeper into what the locals called the Whispering Labyrinth. It didn't whisper, though. It *groaned*, a deep, resonant hum that vibrated through the mossy stones beneath my boots.

"Alright, team," I said, trying to sound confident and not like I was about to walk into a giant spider's web. "Eyes open. Lyra, got those light orbs ready?"

Lyra, ever the picture of serene wisdom despite being not much older than me, nodded. Her violet robes seemed to absorb the dim light filtering through the canopy, making her glow faintly. She held a small, crystalline sphere in her hand, already pulsing with a soft, warm glow. "Ready, Alex. Though my senses suggest the natural light here is... misleading."

"Misleading how?" Kiko, my energetic cat-girl companion, twitched her striped ears, her twin daggers glinting at her hips. She was practically vibrating with excitement. "Like, it *looks* bright but it's actually dark? Ooh, spooky!"

Elara, the elf archer with a gaze sharper than her arrowheads, snorted softly. She adjusted the quiver on her back, her bow already expertly unslung. "She means illusions, Kiko. Or traps designed to make us *think* we see something we don't." She shot me a glance that was half warning, half exasperation. "Let's just hope your 'System Scan' can cut through whatever ancient magic they cooked up here, Alex."

"Hey, it's not foolproof, Elara, but I'll do my best," I replied, a slight flush rising to my cheeks. My System Scan, a unique ability that came with my whole 'isekai'd to another world' package, let me analyze objects and environments for dangers, properties, and sometimes even hidden lore. It was super handy, but not a magic bullet. "Just keep your senses peeled, all of you."

As we stepped under the arch, the groaning intensified, a low bass note beneath the jungle's usual chirps and rustles. The light definitely shifted. What looked like solid stone walls shimmered, revealing glimpses of deeper, darker passages that quickly vanished.

"Whoa," Kiko breathed, her tail lashing back and forth. "Trippy!"

"Indeed," Lyra murmured, her eyes tracing patterns only she could see. "Illusory magic, woven into the very structure. Fascinating."

"Fascinating and dangerous," Elara corrected, her bowstring taut. "My eyes tell me there's something *else* behind that wall, but my instincts scream 'don't trust it'."

This was exactly why I needed them. My System Scan could identify the *type* of illusion or trap, but Elara's natural senses and Lyra's magical intuition were often better at pinpointing the exact location or weakness. Kiko? She was just good at hitting things really, really fast, which was also invaluable.

I activated my System Scan, focusing on the shimmering wall directly ahead. A holographic overlay shimmered over my vision, lines of ancient runes and magical energy flows appearing.

**[Illusionary Wall - Grade B. Crafted with Temporal Displacement and Light Refraction magic. Purpose: Deception, misdirection, and concealment of a primary passage. Warning: Prolonged exposure may induce vertigo and spatial disorientation.]**

"Okay, it's an illusion," I announced. "Temporal Displacement and Light Refraction. Basically, it's messing with time and light to make us think it's something it's not. Don't stare at it too long, or you might get dizzy."

"So, how do we pass through it?" Kiko asked, already bouncing on the balls of her feet.

"Usually, there's a trigger, a key, or a specific magical frequency," Lyra explained, already conjuring a small, shimmering sphere of pure arcane energy in her palm. "Or, sometimes, brute force against the magical field is enough, if one has sufficient power."

"Or a well-placed arrow to disrupt the focus point," Elara added, her eyes narrowing as she scanned the wall.

I zoomed in with my System Scan, looking for the 'focus point'. "Hmm, looks like the main magical nexus is woven into the ceiling, just above the archway. It's radiating outwards, like a giant invisible spider web."

"So, smash the ceiling?" Kiko grinned, already flexing her claws.

"Not quite, Kiko. We risk collapsing the whole entrance," I said quickly. "Lyra, can you try to disrupt its magical flow? Something subtle, non-destructive."

Lyra nodded, her eyes closed in concentration. The arcane sphere in her hand pulsed faster, then she gently pushed it forward. It sailed gracefully towards the shimmering wall, not to hit it, but to *merge* with it. For a moment, nothing happened. Then, the wall rippled, like water disturbed by a pebble. The light flickered wildly, and the groaning sound deepened, sounding more like a frustrated sigh.

"It's resisting," Lyra said, a faint line appearing between her eyebrows. "The ancient enchantments are robust."

"Hold on," Elara interjected, pointing with an arrow. "Look at the floor. The moss here is undisturbed. But look at the pattern of dust."

I looked down. Sure enough, where the illusion showed solid stone, Elara was pointing to a faint, barely visible track in the dust – like something had been dragged through it.

"A secret passage right next to the main one?" I wondered aloud. My System Scan hadn't picked up on a *physical* secret passage, only the illusory nature of the main wall.

"Or the illusion is designed to make us focus on the obvious, while the true path is hidden in plain sight," Elara countered. She walked forward cautiously, tapping the 'solid' stone wall directly adjacent to the main archway with the tip of her arrow. It sounded solid enough, but the groaning definitely lessened when she did.

"Let me try something," I said. "System Scan, focus on *this* specific section of the wall." I pinpointed the area Elara had tapped.

**[Concealed Mechanism - Grade A. Trigger: Specific pressure sequence. Lock Type: Acoustic resonance. Hint: Mimic the 'Whisper' of the Labyrinth.]**

"Acoustic resonance?" I repeated, looking at my companions. "It's not a lever or a button. It responds to sound. And it says 'Mimic the Whisper of the Labyrinth'."

"The groaning?" Kiko's ears twitched again. "You want us to groan at the wall?"

I couldn't help but chuckle. "Not exactly. It's probably a specific frequency, a tone. Lyra, your magical detection might be able to pinpoint it."

Lyra already had her hand pressed against the wall, her eyes closed again. "Yes, I feel it. A low, sustained hum. F sharp, slightly detuned. And a rhythmic pulse within it, like a heartbeat."

"So, an F sharp hum, with a heartbeat rhythm," I summarized. "Anyone good at humming F sharp while doing a heartbeat rhythm?"

Kiko immediately started humming a ridiculously off-key tune while thumping her chest. "Like this? *Mrowwwwnnn-thump-thump-thump!*"

"No, Kiko," Elara sighed, rubbing her temples. "More precise. Lyra, can you amplify your detection, project the sound for us?"

Lyra nodded and concentrated. A faint, almost imperceptible hum filled the air, resonating from the wall. It was low, deep, and had that rhythmic thrum she mentioned. It wasn't menacing; it was... ancient. Like the sigh of a sleeping giant.

"Okay, I think I've got it," I said, taking a deep breath. I wasn't a singer, but I had a pretty good ear. I pressed my hand against the cool stone and tried to mimic the precise hum. My voice isn't powerful, but I focused on the pitch and rhythm.

For a moment, nothing. Then, a low rumble started, deeper than the general groan of the Labyrinth. The section of the wall I was touching began to glow faintly, the moss pulling back as if repelled by an unseen force. With a grind that sounded like ancient teeth, a section of the wall, about six feet tall and three feet wide, slid inwards then sideways, revealing a dark, dust-filled passage.

"Whoa! Alex, you're a human tuning fork!" Kiko cheered, high-fiving the air.

"Nice work, Alex," Elara said, a rare smile gracing her lips. "I knew your weird scans would come in handy eventually."

Lyra gave me a gentle, approving nod. "Exquisite resonance, Alex. It opened flawlessly."

"Alright, everyone stay sharp," I warned, peering into the gloom. My System Scan immediately flared up again.

**[Passage to the Labyrinth Core - Danger Level: Moderate. Environment: Low light, unstable ground. Hazards: Pressure plates, arcane tripwires, predatory Moss Lurkers. Purpose: Guarding the Whisper Crystal.]**

Moss Lurkers? Sounds fun.

"Looks like this passage leads to the 'Labyrinth Core' and guards the 'Whisper Crystal'," I relayed. "And we've got unstable ground, pressure plates, arcane tripwires, and 'predatory Moss Lurkers'. Sounds like a party."

"Moss Lurkers?" Kiko repeated, her eyes wide. "Are they fuzzy? Can I pet them after I punch them?"

"Let's not find out the petting part first, Kiko," Elara advised, nudging her forward. "Alex, lead the way. Lyra, keep a light source ready. Kiko, watch our backs. I'll cover the flanks."

"Got it," I said, and stepped into the darkness, my System Scan painting the floor ahead with an intricate grid of potential dangers. It was like playing a real-life video game, only the 'game over' screen was significantly more permanent.

The passage was narrow, the air even heavier. Lyra conjured another light orb, this one brighter, floating ahead of us like a friendly firefly. It cast long, dancing shadows, making the already uneven ground seem to writhe.

"Pressure plate, three steps ahead, dead center," I called out, my voice low. "Elara, can you check for any tripwires near the left wall?"

Elara was already on it, her keen eyes scanning the almost invisible threads of arcane energy my System Scan could just barely highlight. "Confirmed. Two tripwires, knee-height. And another one lower, near the right wall."

"Clever," Lyra mused. "Designed to catch intruders regardless of their size or gait."

"Not clever enough for us," Kiko chirped, gracefully leaping over the pressure plate and then ducking under the first tripwire, rolling smoothly beneath the second before springing back to her feet. She made it look effortless. "See? Like dancing!"

"Just try not to *activate* anything, Kiko," I said, carefully sidestepping the pressure plate and then ducking under the tripwires, my heart thumping a little faster. This was the kind of close call that always got my adrenaline pumping.

We moved deeper, navigating a maze of hidden dangers. Each step was a calculated risk. My System Scan was working overtime, and Lyra's magical sense combined with Elara's sharp eyes caught things I might have missed. Kiko, despite her playful demeanor, was surprisingly adept at identifying unstable floor tiles by their subtle creaks, often catching them before my scan even registered them.

After what felt like an hour, the passage opened into a larger chamber. This wasn't a natural cavern; it was clearly artificial, carved from the very earth, yet overgrown with the same glowing moss that permeated the Labyrinth. In the center, on a raised pedestal, pulsed a multifaceted crystal. It was the size of a human head, shimmering with an inner light that shifted through blues, greens, and purples. This had to be the Whisper Crystal.

"Wow," Kiko whispered, for once completely still, her eyes wide with awe. "It's beautiful."

"The Whisper Crystal," Lyra breathed, her voice tinged with reverence. "So the legends were true. It holds immense temporal energy."

"And it's probably not just sitting there, waiting for us to pick it up," Elara said, her gaze sweeping the chamber. Her bow was already drawn, an arrow nocked.

She was right. As if on cue, the glowing moss on the walls began to ripple and shift. Darker patches detached themselves, forming into grotesque, vaguely humanoid shapes. They were made of thick, pulsating moss and glowing fungi, their eyes like twin pinpricks of crimson light. Moss Lurkers.

"Guess we found our welcoming committee," I said, pulling out my own enchanted dagger, its blade humming softly. "Lyra, defensive spells ready! Elara, focus fire on the ones closest to the crystal. Kiko, you're on crowd control, keep them from swarming us!"

"Got it!" Kiko grinned, her daggers a blur as she charged into the nearest Moss Lurker, a whirlwind of claws and steel. She was fearless.

Lyra raised her staff, and a shimmering shield of pure energy enveloped us, just as the first wave of Moss Lurkers lunged forward. They slammed into the barrier with dull thuds, their fungal forms crackling.

"They're faster than they look!" Elara shouted, letting loose a volley of arrows. Each one struck true, piercing the mossy bodies, causing them to explode in a cloud of spores and glowing dust. But more were coming, peeling off the walls, rising from the floor.

My System Scan was going crazy, identifying each Lurker's weak points. "Go for the glowing fungal patches! They're the core!" I yelled, dodging a swing from a particularly large Lurker that had managed to phase partway through Lyra's shield. My dagger flashed, carving through its weak point, and it dissolved with a wet hiss.

Kiko was a blur, dodging and weaving, her daggers a dazzling dance of destruction. She was an absolute beast in close combat, turning the Lurkers into piles of inert plant matter. "Whee! So squishy!"

Elara, meanwhile, was a deadly sniper, her arrows finding their mark with terrifying precision, taking down the bigger threats before they could get close. She wasn't just shooting; she was analyzing their movements, predicting their next lunge.

Lyra kept our shield strong, occasionally lashing out with bursts of arcane energy that incinerated entire groups of Lurkers. Her calm demeanor never wavered, even in the thick of battle.

We fought as a unit, a well-oiled machine. Me, the strategist and close-range disruptor; Elara, the ranged DPS; Lyra, the powerful mage and defender; and Kiko, the unstoppable melee force. My heart pounded with the thrill of the fight, but also with the fierce protectiveness I felt for my companions. They were awesome, each in their own way.

Just as we seemed to be getting the upper hand, a guttural roar echoed through the chamber, shaking the very foundations. From a darker alcove behind the pedestal, something truly massive emerged. It was a Moss Lurker, but easily ten times the size of the others, its form a hulking, moss-covered monstrosity with glowing red eyes and long, vine-like tendrils for arms. It pulsed with dark energy.

**[Greater Moss Lurker - Threat Level: High. Abilities: Spore Burst, Vine Grapple, Regeneration. Weakness: Core Node (highly protected).]**

"Uh oh," Kiko said, her usual grin replaced with a serious frown. "Boss fight!"

"Lyra, reinforce the shield! Elara, focus on those vine tendrils!" I shouted, my mind racing. "Kiko, distract it! Get its attention away from the crystal!"

The Greater Moss Lurker bellowed again, and a cloud of corrosive spores erupted from its body, forcing us back. This wasn't going to be easy. We had come for the Whisper Crystal, but it looked like this Labyrinth had one final, monstrous guardian determined to keep its secrets buried. And it was just getting started.📄 已載入章節檔: chapter14_draft.md。您可以直接在下方修改內容。
